Convert terms of service documents tracked by the [TermsOfS;Didn't Read
Project](https://tosdr.org) to RSS so that they can be tracked by
[diffengine](https://github.com/docnow/diffengine). Specifically the rules xml
documents found in the
[tosdr/tosback2](https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/tree/master/rules) project
are downloaded parsed and written out as RSS.

Converting the rules to RSS may seem like a step backwards but it is just a
necessary step to get a diffengine instance to monitor the URLs it contains.
